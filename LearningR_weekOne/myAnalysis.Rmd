```{r }
# Aljohura's solution
chickTable <- chickwts %>%

  summarise(n = length(feed),
            Average = mean(weight),

```

## All pair-wise comparisons


```{r}
# Aljohura's solution

#There're two way to get ANOV result and if you want to get a tukey you need to do it this way. 
chickwts.av <-  aov(weight ~ feed, data = chickwts)
#insted of the lm() we use aov()
tukeyTest <- TukeyHSD(chickwts.av)

datatable(tukeyTest$feed)
```

## Our dataset
```{r display}

```
This dataset describe the amount of .....

To get better known of our dataset:

```{r summary}
str(chickwts)
summary(chickwts)
```


to get the mean and the SD of the dataset

```{r desc_stats}
chickwts %>% 
  group_by(feed) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(),
            avg = mean(weight), 
            sd1 = sd(weight)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

## Including Plots
```{r jitter_plot}
ggplot (chickwts, aes(feed, weight)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.3) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_sdl, 
               fun.args = list(mult = 1), 
               col = "red")
